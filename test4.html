  content: "When I entered elementary school, I had a strong speech impediment including a lisp and most people had a hard time understanding me. Because my adopted Korean sister could understand me, people assumed I was speaking in Korean and she was translating for me. In order to overcome my speech impediment, I was sent to special education classes to have oral-motor speech therapy. I hazily remember sitting in a classroom with children that had mental and physical disabilities and not understanding what my problem was. I didnâ€™t understand that no one outside of my immediate family had trouble understanding me.";
